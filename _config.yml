 - {title: "Embedded ML - Tiny ML", image: "Embedded ML-TinyML.png", text: "TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of tiny devices and embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software." }
 - {title: "Summer School", image: "conference.jpg", text: "In the tradition of previous Data Science Africa  events, a summer school on machine learning and data science will be held prior to the main workshop. This summer school will target graduate students, researchers and professionals working with huge amounts of data or unique datasets.
" }
 - {title: "Workshop", image: "workshop.jpg", text: "The workshop will be organized around paper presentations and interactive panel discussions. The theme for the workshop is Women and Data in Africa. We want to highlight the work of women data scientists and increase representation of women in Data Science in Africa. We strongly encourage the participation of women from across the continent." }

aboutUs: "The last few years have witnessed an explosion in the quantity and variety of data available in Africa, produced either as a by-product of digital services, from sensors or measuring devices, satellites and from many other sources. A number of practical fields have been transformed by the ability to collect large volumes of data: for example, bioinformatics with the development of high throughput sequencing technology capable of measuring gene expression in cells, or agriculture with the widespread availability of high quality remote sensing data. For other data sources – such as mobile phone usage records from telecoms operators, which can be used to measure population movement and economic activity – we are just beginning to understand the practical possibilities."

This will be based on a research project aimed at developing experimental tools and techniques needed for the surveillance and detection of serious viral crop diseases, which affect Uganda and the East African region. The following core areas have been investigated on and will be demonstrated during the field study. These include <ol type='circle'><li>mobile data collection in the field</li><li> diagnosis of crop disease in the field based on crop images </li><li> mobile phone applications for auto pest and disease count</li><li>Spectrometry of early disease dectection</li></ol>"} 
 - {title: "Air pollution monitoring", image: "AirQoFieldwork.png", details: "The objective of this field work is to provide participants with hands-on experience on building an air quality IoT device. The session will start with an introduction to air pollution, its effects, different types of pollutants and air quality sensing technologies. Participants will be able to prototype and deploy an IoT device that is capable of collecting air quality data and transmitting it in real-time to a cloud-based platform for analysis."}
